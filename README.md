Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Finance graduate and a curious beginner in the world of Quantitative Finance, where I combine financial knowledge with data, algorithms, and code. I’m learning to build insightful, data-driven financial models that help make sense of market behavior.

Fun fact: **I got into quant finance because I love patterns — both in numbers and in life.**
